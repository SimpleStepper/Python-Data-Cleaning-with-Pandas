# Python Data Cleaning with Pandas
This project focuses on cleaning and standardizing a customer call list dataset using Python and the Pandas library. The goal was to prepare the raw Excel data for use in customer outreach systems by fixing formatting issues, removing incomplete data, and ensuring standardized fields. The final project filters data down to useable client information for a customer outreach agent.
